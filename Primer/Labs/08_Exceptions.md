# Exceptions
 
# Overview
In this lab, you'll review some of the modules we wrote in previous labs and add exception handling.

First, you'll add various operator methods that will allow Employee objects to be compared with each other, based on their salary. Then you'll define a new class named Programmer, which will inherit from Employee and support some new and improved features.

# Roadmap

There are 4 exercises in this lab, of which the last exercise is "if time permits". Here is a brief summary of the tasks you will perform in each exercise; more detailed instructions follow later:
1. Repeat until valid value
2. Test values


# Exercise 1 - Repeat until valid value

exercise1.py has a module we wrote around circles and spheres. At the moment, if the user types in a non-numeric input the program crashes. Your job is to catch that exception and retry until you get a valid response.

Suggestions:
- You'll want to loop indefinitely
- If you get a valid input, you'll want to break out of the loop unconditionally
- You'll want to give some feedback to the user if they do give invalid input

# Exercise 2 - Test values

exercise2.py has a date module we worked on previously. Keep repeating until the user gives valid input.

Suggestions:
- This should be similar to the previous exercise
- You may have to move some of your logic into functions (peek at the solution for a possible approach)
